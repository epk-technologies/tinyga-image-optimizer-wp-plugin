This plugin allows you to optimize your WordPress images through the Tinyga API.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to optimize and resize new and existing Wordpress image uploads through [Tinyga Image Optimizer's](https://tinyga.cz "Tinyga Image Optimizer") API.

= Quick start tutorial: =

1. Upload the tinyga-image-optimizer to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enter your Tinyga API key into the new **Tinyga Settings** section of Settings->Media.
4. Any images you upload from now on using Wordpress's Media Upload will be optimized according to your settings. Auto-generated thumbnails will also be optimized.
5. Images already present can be optimized from within the Media Library.

== Notes and Incompatible plugins ==
If you use the Kraken.io plugin or WP Super Cache plugin, you must **disable the plugin** prior to performing any image optimization, as it is known to cause strange and buggy behaviour with the Tinyga Image Optimizer plugin.
